                <p>I like to play Badminton because it's an indoor sport, so you can play it in any time of the year,any time of day and it's a great type of social event where you can have fun with friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play.The better you get at Badminton the more and more fun it is! When I get free I Definately play  with my friends and my brother. It makes you feel Great and if you play it once you will definately play it daily.</p>
